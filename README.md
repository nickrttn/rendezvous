# Rendezvous
Rendezvous engages backpackers socially by creating more offline interaction.

It features two account-types: backpackers and hostels. Rendezvous at its most basic level is a list of activities you can sign up for, or add to. Activities are owned by a specific hostel, and thus, Rendezvous is superlocal.

Backpackers get access to a list of activities by holding their phone near an iBeacon (simulated in the current version) in a hostel. They only get to see and add to that list of activities specific to that hostel. The interaction is simple: you can only tap 'Join' or create a new activity. When you join an activity you go out and do fun stuff with peers, hopefully leaving your phone at the hostel.

Hostelowners can log in to Rendezvous without scanning for the iBeacon and add (paid) activities for backpackers from the backend of the application. This way Rendezvous attempts to create value for hostelowners as well as backpackers.

Built with the Meteor.js platform.

Check out an example on: http://37.48.115.174/ and fill in 1 for hostelId after creating an account.
